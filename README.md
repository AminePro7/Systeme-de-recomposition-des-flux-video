# Video Surveillance System

## Description
This project aims to develop a video surveillance system using AI to optimize the processing and automatic detection of critical situations. The system reassembles incoming video streams by compiling the most relevant areas before analyzing them.

## Features
- Multi-stream video input support.
- Automatic selection and compilation of relevant image areas.
- AI-based automatic detection of critical events.
- Real-time or delayed alerts to the supervision staff.
- Interactive dashboard for live and historical video visualization.
- Recording and storage of original and reassembled video streams.

## Technologies
- Backend: FastAPI
- Frontend: To be determined (React, Vue.js, etc.)
- Video Processing: OpenCV
- AI: TensorFlow
- Notifications: Twilio
- Containerization: Docker
